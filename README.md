# Sudoku-Solver
A simple sudoku solver using backtracking and pygame for the GUI

Followed a tutorial by Tech with Tim on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqUwSA0xI-s&t=871s&ab_channel=TechWithTim) to learn backtracking,
then learned how to use the pygame module to create the GUI

To use the solver, simply hover over the desired square and press the number. If you have invalid input, when you click solve, the screen will tell you (for example,
if you have two 1's in a square, a message will appear stating "Invalid Input" and the extra 1 will be red instead of black)

To solve the puzzle, click the solve button. To reset the puzzle, press the resest button. 

If you inputed the wrong number, or if you put it in the wrong square, hover over it and press "0"
